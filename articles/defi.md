# dapps
Decentralised applications, or *dapps* just refer to smart contracts that are executed on a blockchain. When combined with a frontend these dapps can appear just like any other web application with the key difference being that that code and/or user data is stored on the blockchain. 

The [most used dapps](https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/ethereum) on Ethereum in 2021:

| App            | Category                | Users (k/30 days) |
|:-------------  |:-----                   |-------:|
| Uniswap        |  Decentralised Exchange |    520 |
| OpenSea        |  NFT Marketplace        |    304 |
| MetaMask Swap  |  Decentralised Exchange |    166 |
| Polygon Bridge | Bridge                  |    114 |
| Sushi          | Decentralised Finance   |     98 |

Other categories of dapps that are popular are gaming and gambling although the last few years have been dominated by [DeFi](defi.md) (decentralised finance) and 2021 saw breakout growth in NFTs (Non-fungible tokens) art & collectibles.

### Stablecoins
Although not listed in the chart above, stable-value currencies were originally categorized as applications that can run on Ethereum. Now called *stablecoins*, it is hard to ignore their growth and popularity when looking at total value. The idea behind them is that to avoid the volatility present in the crypto markets, rather than using $ETH there is the option to use a crypto token pegged to a common currency like the $USD. If you convert some $NZD to Tether today, then you can rely on the value being relatively stable to use it in the future. Some of the stablecoins that exist on Ethereum are Tether ($USDT), $USDC, and $DAI. Both Tether and USDC are issued privately, whereas DAI is a *Decentralized Autonomous Organization* (DAO) and maintains a US dollar peg.

Chart from [TheBlock](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/stablecoins) showing growth in stablecoins over the past four years. The total value of stablecoins rose in 2021 from ~$28B to $150B. Note that this chart includes other blockchains, not just Ethereum.
