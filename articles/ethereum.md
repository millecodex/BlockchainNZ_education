# What is Ethereum?
First, a brief history of the problems that Vitalik Buterin was looking to solve. 

Bitcoin provided a solution to the double-spend problem of creating digital cash by using proof-of-work mining to both maintain the state of the ledger and allow open participation in the network based on computing power. By assigning value to these digitally scarce coins the ledger can be used as a monetary system. This works great for money but comes up short when using Bitcoin's scripting language to make simple extensions such as a decentralized exchange -- how to determine the NZD/BTC rate? or how to do some arbitrary calculation, e.g. what is the probability that your game character encounters a villan?

While writing for *Bitcoin Weekly* and co-founding [*Bitcoin Magazine*](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/), Vitalik saw the limitations in Bitcoin as an opportunity to create a new blockchain from scratch that can allow developers to build general applications. The first feature to include in this new blockchain was *Turing completness*. In computer programming this means it is possible to have loops in the code which would be necessary, for example, for calculating a probability or the value of pi. Bicoin's *script* language is not considered Turing complete because it is stack-based and therefore anything that is needed by the program must be loaded onto the stack. (Also, by definition stacks cannot loop.) 

The second feature was to use an account-based system. The benefit of this style is that each account (address) has a balance *and* the option of some code and storage. (This is in contrast to Bitcoin that uses a UTXO model I won't detail here but basically can only keep track of coins and not any additional data or code.)

### Summarized in the whitepaper, Ethereum is:
> a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where they can create their own arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions.

The whitepaper for *Ethereum* was published online in 2013 and a year later a formal specification was written by Gavin Wood and the project raised funds through their initial coin offering. This was followed by the network launch in 2015.

# Initial Coin Offering
In order to fund their new proposed blockchain network, the founders embarked on a unique fundraising scheme that laid down the template for future crowdfunding sales. An initial coin offering (ICO) seeks to bootstrap user adoption and funding by combining the style of an initial public offering (IPO) with a crowd fund model. A marked difference from the IPO model is that the token sale was open to anyone without geographic or regulatory restriction. All users had to do to participate was deposit bitcoin and receive *ether* tokens that represent their stake in the new network. The token sale was successful resulting in more than 50 million ether (the native currency of ethereum) being sold. Investors were aware of the token distribution from the beginning which included 9.9% of the tokens reserved for the founders (to fund development, salaries, bug bounties, etc.) and another 9.9% for a [foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/) that was set up to guide the long term mission of the network. These tokens didn't have to be purchased in a traditional sense; a practice now known as *pre-mining*.

### ICO Boom Times
The success of Ethereum's ICO and its smart contract capability combined with its open source code made it an ideal model for other founders to fund their projects. A new project could easily copy and modify smart contract code and host their own ICO and issue their own new ERC-20 tokens. (ERC-20 refers to the token standard that most coins that run on Ethereum use.) 2017--2018 was a boom period for ICOs with many projects and tokens launching. Unfortunately many of them had questionable products and practices or were outright scams and because there was no regulation in crypto (as there is for an IPO), there was no recourse for those that invested and lost their money (this author included ðŸ™ƒ). 

# Smart Contracts
* Arbitrary Computation
* gas
* dapps
* Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

# PoW / PoS
* from the ICO 26% of tokens were reserved to be distributed to the miners
* Proof-of-Stake? difficulty bomb / ETH 2.0
* unlimited supply

# Applications
* stable coins
* defi
* dapps
* nfts / cryptokitties / punks

# Scaling
* ETH2
* alternate L1's
* arbitrum

# What did we miss?
* sharding
* rollups
* DAO hack
*
