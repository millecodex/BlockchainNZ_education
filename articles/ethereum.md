# What is Ethereum?
First, a brief history of the problems that Vitalik Buterin was looking to solve. 

Bitcoin provided a solution to the double-spend problem of creating digital cash by using proof-of-work mining to both maintain the state of the ledger and allow open participation in the network based on computing power. By assigning value to these digitally scarce coins the ledger can be used as a monetary system. This works great for money but comes up short when using the scripting language to make simple extensions such as a decentralized exchange -- how to determine the NZD/BTC rate? Or how to do some arbitrary calculation, e.g. what is the probability your game character encounters a villan?

While writing for *Bitcoin Weekly* and co-founding *Bitcoin Magazine*, Vitalik saw the limitations in Bitcoin as an opportunity to create a new from-scratch blockchain. The first feature to include was *Turing* completness. In computer programming this means it is possible to have loops in the code which would be necessary for calculating a probability or the value of pi. Bicoin's script language is not considered Turing complete because it is stack-based and therefore anything that is needed must be loaded onto the stack. (Also, by definition stacks cannot loop.) 

The second feature was to use an account-based system. The benefit of this style is that each account by default has a balance and the option of some code and storage. (This is in contract to Bitcoin that uses a UTXO model I wont' detail here.)

### Summarized in the whitepaper, Ethereum is:
> a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where they can create their own arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions.
