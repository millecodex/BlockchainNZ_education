# What is a blockchain?
A blockchain is a data structure with a unique set of properties suited to decentralized systems. The data in a blockchain is usually wrapped in a package called a block and when the network is updated with new information this block is linked to the previous update. In this manner the links form a chain that cannot be broken without invalidating the entire chain. In order to keep the data immutable, in a public blockchain there are many participants each storing a copy of the data and agreeing on any updates. These nodes keep the network decentralized—without a mainframe or single-point-of-failure, and transparent—open to anyone to audit the activity and participate. 

Sometimes referred to as decentralized-ledger technology, or DLT, a blockchain consists of many pieces: a network protocol to communcate with other participants, a consensus mechanism to agree on the state of the ledger, a method of data storage, a transaction queue to decide what to do next, and some business logic, i.e. What can this blockchain do? Can it keep track of account balances? Can it run snippits of code (smart contracts)? Can it record weather data?

Many blockchain projects are open-sourced so improvements are made by the community of developers, or copies can be make (forks) that implement different features.

# What is a cryptocurrency?
Bitcoin was the first blockchain and presented the first use case—money. The problem of digital cash was unsovled until Satoshi Nakamoto (an alias) released software in 2008 as an experiment to see if his version could prevent coins from being copied and incentivise people to join the network. Bitcoin is referred to as a cryptocurency because user's coins are kept secure from theft using asymmetric encryption (the same technology that keeps credit card details safe when shopping online). Today there are myriad cryptocurrencies with different properties and blockchains, however, all can trace their roots back to Bitcoin.
