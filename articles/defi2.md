# Introduction
In Part 1.0 we covered some foundational parts of DeFi: stablecoins, decentralized exchanges and how the automated market maker works with pool, liquidity mining and yield farming. Here we're going to start with a foundational product - YFI. What happens when you can automate some of the behaviour witnessed in part 1.0?

# What did we miss (From Part I)?
* [Defi 2.0](https://github.com/millecodex/BlockchainNZ_education/blob/main/articles/defi2.md) is the dive into more complex and obscure financial stuff happening on the blockchain. Here you will find a primer on: 
  * yield aggregators & vaults YFI  
  * algorithmic stablecoins - USDN, FEI, FRAX, UST: see Messario 2021 report p.120.
  * non-pegged stablecoins & protocol owned liquidity
  * flash loans
  * rebasing
  * oracles
  * pool 1 vs. pool 2
  * options/derivatives/perps(dydx) etc 
  * Single-sided staking and IL insurance
  * Self-repaying loans(!)

# Algorithmic Stables 
* USDN, FEI, FRAX, UST: see Messario 2021 report p.120.

# Liquidity Owned Protocols
* pool1/pool2
* non-pegged - OHM - A free floating, or non-pegged coin is allowed to fluctuate up as much as demand will tolerate and down to floor based on its treasury. In order to build up the treasury to a sizable value (>~$1B? to back-stop the token) the protocol offers users incentives via a discount to mint new tokens. I.e. you can buy $100 worth of tokens for $95 if you particpate in the bonding program. At the end of a vesting period you are issued the new token that can only be exchanged at market value. 2021 say immense popularity in Olympus DAO leading the way with about a $700M treasury built up in less than a year at a market value of over $3B.
* rebasing
* options/derivatives/perps(dydx) etc
