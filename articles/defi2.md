# DeFi Part II (& 2.0)

# Introduction
In Part 1.0 we covered some foundational parts of DeFi: stablecoins, decentralized exchanges, the automated market maker & pools, liquidity mining and yield farming. Here we're going to start by looking at happens when you can automate some of the behaviour witnessed in part 1.0. Eventually we'll get to [DeFi2.0](defi2.md#DeFi2.0) and discuss algorithmic coins, rebasing, and self-repaying loans.

# Yield Aggregators & Vaults
The winter of Defi (2020; Summer in the northern hemisphere) looked at yields coming out of farms and saw the trend of capital hopping around to the projects with the highest interest rate. So a simple question arises: how can I, a simple investor, capture some of this yield by moving my coins (without gas fees eating into my profits)?

[Andre Cronje](https://andrecronje.medium.com/) was there with yEarn to automatically move investments between dydx, Compound, and Aave. The native token, YFI, was advertised as having no value and was distributed through a liquidity mining program to users and was so successful it now trades at tens of thousands of dollars. 

As with other successful DeFi bricks, this model was copied eagerly and now aggregators and vaults are common. The present version of yearn.finance offers a vault for depositing tokens that then use strategies such as shifting capital, auto-compounding, and rebalancing. These vaults offer self-custody and allow withdrawals at any time, both features which represent reduced risk to the user. They also offer a bank that is used for borowing/lending activities; again, common features in the defi landscape.



# Topics not in Part I (1.0)

  * algorithmic stablecoins - USDN, FEI, FRAX, UST: see Messario 2021 report p.120.
  * non-pegged stablecoins & protocol owned liquidity
  * flash loans (1.0)
  * rebasing
  * oracles (~ necessary infrastructure)
  * pool 1 vs. pool 2 (motivation for 2.0 innovation)
  * options/derivatives/perps(dydx) etc 
  * Single-sided staking and IL insurance (Bancor v3)
  * Self-repaying loans(!) Abracadabra/MIM

# Algorithmic Stables 
* USDN, FEI, FRAX, UST: see Messario 2021 report p.120.

# Liquidity Owned Protocols
* pool1/pool2
* non-pegged - OHM - A free floating, or non-pegged coin is allowed to fluctuate up as much as demand will tolerate and down to floor based on its treasury. In order to build up the treasury to a sizable value (>~$1B? to back-stop the token) the protocol offers users incentives via a discount to mint new tokens. I.e. you can buy $100 worth of tokens for $95 if you particpate in the bonding program. At the end of a vesting period you are issued the new token that can only be exchanged at market value. 2021 say immense popularity in Olympus DAO leading the way with about a $700M treasury built up in less than a year at a market value of over $3B.
* rebasing
* options/derivatives/perps(dydx) etc
