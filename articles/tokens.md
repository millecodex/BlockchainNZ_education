# Introduction
Why would tokens need an introduction? Everyone knows what a token is. Alas, that's not why you're here. Lets start with an example. Here in West Auckland we need to put tags on our rubbish and recycling bins before they will be collected and emptied by the waste disposal folks. Not just any tags though. The nice plastic stickers have to be the ones specifically appointed by the council. You can get them at the grocery store or library, but you will have to pay. Presently $3.80 for a standard 120 litre bin. ($4.25 if you're on the North Shore. Fancypants.)

The tag is a token. Each one is interchangeable with another one of the same colour. Each one has an underlying value determined by the issue price set by the council and enforced by the difficulty in conterfeiting. And each tag has utility, in this case a weekly empyting of your bin. In an extreme scenario you could even imagine a tag market emerging where those close to the tag-printer skim off the top and cut their neighbours in on a discount, benefiting both parties financially. Eventually the council will have to raise tag prices to cover the loss and thus affect the average every-tagger in their weekly budget. This embezzlement has now inflated the price of a tag and distorted the value (the rubbish trucks still only collect 1 bin per week). council rubbish tage are a hidden tax that disproportionately affect the lower socioeconomic class. Thankfully this is just a hypothetical scenario.

Back to the tag being a token. The digital representation has many of the same properties, namely it is fungible (interchangeable), secure (can't be stolen), scarce (can't be copied), valuable (someone would pay for it), and has utility (otherwise why do I need it?). Additionally we have described many of the properties of money itself, and this may be why a distinction between cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, securities, and collectibles can be fuzzy and subjective.
